# 3D Designs for Raspberry Pi Camera Stand

This folder contains 3D designs for a Raspberry Pi camera stand, which is an essential part of the robot's structure.

The available files include different formats (*F3D*, *IGS*, *STL*), making it easy to use the designs for 3D modeling, 3D printing, or modification according to project needs. These designs are crucial for enhancing the robot's vision accuracy and efficiency in performing designated tasks. We hope this work contributes to fostering innovation in the field of robotics and achieving outstanding results in competitions.
