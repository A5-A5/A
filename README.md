# WRO 2024 Self-Driving Car Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the documentation, code, and resources for our participation in the **WRO 2024 Future Engineers - Self-Driving Car Challenge**. Our goal is to build an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a track, avoiding obstacles, and performing parallel parking as part of the competition.

## Team Information
- **Team Name**: RayBot 2030
- **Team Members**:
  - AlJawharah AlQahtani 
  - Aseel AlJaser 
 
- **Coach**: Eng. Khalid Hussain Ghubaish

## Vehicle Overview
Our vehicle is designed using [Raspberry Pi 5, along with various sensors and motors to autonomously complete the challenge tasks.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Mobility
- **Motor Type**: one DC Motor for forward-movements.
- **Steering Mechanism**: one Servo-Motor.

### 2. Sensors
- **Sensors Used**: Rpi-Camera Module 3, LiDAR, Whole Sensor, Battery Monitor 
- **Functionality**: [Explain what each sensor does and how it helps the vehicle complete its tasks].

### 3. Obstacle Avoidance Strategy
- **Obstacle Detection**: [Explain how your vehicle detects and responds to obstacles].
- **Control Logic**: [Describe the logic or algorithm used to avoid obstacles, including pseudo code or flowcharts if available].

### 4. Power Management
- **Power Supply**: [Describe the battery system, voltage, and how power is distributed].
- **Energy Efficiency**: [Mention any methods implemented to optimize power consumption].

## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup
